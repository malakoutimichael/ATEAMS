		Initializes Swendsen-Wang evolution on the Potts model.

		Args:
			C (Complex): The `Complex` object on which we'll be running experiments.
			dimension (int=1): The dimension of cells on which we're percolating.
			field (int=2): Field characteristic.
			temperature (Callable): A temperature schedule function which

				scheduled temperature at time `t`.
			initial (np.array): A vector of spin assignments to components.
			dtypes (tuple=(np.int,np.byte,np.byte)): A tuple of NumPy data types
				to which output data are cast.
