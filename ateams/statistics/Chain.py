class Chain:
	"""
	Simulates a Markov chain on the given Model. For example, to generate 1000 samples
	from 2-dimensional Potts lattice gauge theory with coefficients in \(\mathbb Z/5\mathbb Z\)
	and store the spins on each 1-cell and the occupied 2-cells, use something like

	```python
	from ateams import Chain, Recorder
	from ateams.statistics import critical
	from ateams.complexes import Cubical
	from ateams.models import SwendsenWang

	# Construct the cubical complex; instantiate model, chain.
	C = Cubical().fromCorners([10]*4)
	SW = SwendsenWang(C, dimension=2, field=5, temperature=critical(5))
	M = Chain(SW, steps=1000)

	# Run the chain, storing the output.
	with Recorder().record("out.lz") as rec:
		for (spins, occupied) in M.progress():
			# You can store as many outputs as you'd like --- even ones
			# that aren't spit out by the model --- but they must be passed
			# to the `.store()` method as a tuple.
			rec.store((spins, occupied))
	```

	The `Recorder` class stores the differences between consecutive iterations using
	the [LZ4 compression schema](github.com/lz4/lz4), compressing the diffs in
	chunks of (default) size 100. You can replay the data with the `Player`
	class:
	
	```python
	from ateams import Player

	with Player().playback("out.lz", steps=1000) as play:
		for (spins, occupied) in play.progress():
			<do whatever>
	```

	Running the sampler and recording the data takes ~26 seconds (~38 it/s) on
	an M2 MacBook Air; replaying the data takes ~0 seconds (~24,211 it/s). The
	size of `out.lz` is ~1.8MB, so storing each cell's data requires \(1/11\)th
	of a byte per iteration (amortized).
